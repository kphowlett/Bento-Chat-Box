# Bento-Chat-Box
DAEN 690 Capstone Project

The purpose of this repository is to store our code for our website stored in our AWS S3 Bucket which has our Amazon Lex chatbot embedded onto it.

To get started with development, open your IDE of choice (preferably one that has access to live server functionality) and clone this repository. 
Then, open the index.html file and start a live server on any port of your choice to start the website from your local server.

# Project Descriptions
Bento Chatbot

The team will utilize a collection of resources to build a custom chatbot using Amazon Lex. Our client (Essential Software Inc. (ESI)) is requesting an Amazon Lex AI chatbot for querying and filtering data in the Bento API (https://bento-tools.org/v1/graphql). The initial query results must allow for the specification of filters as designated by the Bento dashboard (https://bento-tools.org/#/explore) and for user feedback/modifications before file export. Finally, a file export service will be designed and implemented to produce a downloadable file in the format of the downloadable manifest available on the Bento Cart page (https://bento-tools.org/#/fileCnetricCart). Additional requirements include metrics and data previews for all query results.
