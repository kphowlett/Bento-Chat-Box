# Bento-Chat-Box
DAEN 690 Capstone Project

The purpose of this repository is to store our code for our website stored in our AWS S3 Bucket which has our Amazon Lex chatbot embedded onto it.

To get started with development, open your IDE of choice (preferably one that has access to live server functionality) and clone this repository. 
Then, open the index.html file and start a live server on any port of your choice to start the website from your local server.
